    <h1><center>Introduction to javascript</center></h1>
    <p>
        Javascript was initially created to "make web pages alive",

        The program in this language are called scripts.They can be written right in a webpages HTML and run automatically
        as the page loads.

         scripts are provided and executed as plain text.They dont need special preparation or compilation to run.

         In this aspect,Javascript is very different from another language called java.
